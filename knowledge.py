CONTEXT = """
As a Logistics Manager, I am currently responsible for the global logistics of IoT devices, ensuring their timely delivery to and retrieval from operational sites worldwide. This core function of my role involves planning and managing a variety of international freight methods, including air and sea shipments, to meet diverse and time-sensitive requirements. My experience directly aligns with the need for a professional to manage a global pool of sensor devices that are crucial for providing clients with end-to-end supply chain visibility through real-time cargo monitoring.

My expertise in planning worldwide transports and controlling inventory has prepared me to not only manage but also to expand and optimize an existing logistics network. I am proficient in cost and performance controlling and accustomed to demand and inventory planning to ensure service readiness. With a background that includes direct customer contact and close collaboration with international management teams, coupled with negotiation-fluent English and a networked, analytical mindset, I am well-equipped to contribute to a dynamic logistics team and enhance its operational efficiency.

A key part of my role is also managing the technical aspects of these devices and ensuring their functionality. Many of these IoT devices are advanced enough to monitor their own shipment conditions, such as security, temperature, and humidity, guaranteeing their integrity throughout the journey.
