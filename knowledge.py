With a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics and practical experience in customer support gained during my studies, I have a strong foundation in both technical and client-facing roles.

Currently, I am responsible for the global logistics of IoT devices, ensuring their timely delivery to and retrieval from operational sites worldwide. This involves managing a variety of freight methods, including air and sea shipments, to meet diverse logistical requirements.

A key part of my role is also managing the technical aspects of these devices and ensuring their functionality. Many of these IoT devices are advanced enough to monitor their own shipment conditions, such as security, temperature, and humidity, guaranteeing their integrity throughout the journey.
